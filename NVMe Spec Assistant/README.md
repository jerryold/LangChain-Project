# Read NVMe Spec in a Langchain PipelineðŸ“•
This project highlights how to leverage a ChromaDB vectorstore in a Langchain pipeline to create NVMe Specification Assisant to help developer who can search SSD related work with the Assistant answer . You can load in a pdf based document and use it alongside an LLM without the need for fine tuning. 


# Introduction ðŸš€
1. Create a virtual environment `python -m venv langchainenv`
2. Activate it: 
   - Windows:`.\langchainenv\Scripts\activate`
   - Mac: `source langchain/bin/activate`
3. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/jerryold/LangChain-Project/NVMe Specification Assisant`
4. Go into the directory `cd LangchainDocuments`
5. Install the required dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Add your own OpenAI APIKey to line 22 of `app.py`
#### OpenAI APIKEY-The most import thing is that you need apply your own key in offical websiteðŸ”‘
