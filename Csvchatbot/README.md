# Read NVMe Spec in a Langchain PipelineðŸ“•
This project highlights how to leverage a ChromaDB vectorstore in a Langchain pipeline to create chatbot to analyze with the csv file . You can load in a csv based document and use it alongside an LLM without the need for fine tuning. In our case, we utilitize it on the financial report of the Taiwan Stock
